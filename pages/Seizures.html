                        <p>First aid for seizures involves ensuring the person's safety, protecting them from injury, 
						and offering support until the seizure ends.
                             <br>
                        <p>Here are the steps for providing first aid for seizures:
                             <br>
                            <h5>1. Stay Calm:</h5>
                             - Stay calm and reassure those around you. Most seizures are brief and will end on their own.
							 <br> <br>
							<h5>2. Ensure Safety:</h5>
                            - Clear the area around the person to prevent injury. Remove any sharp objects or obstacles 
							that could cause harm.
							<br>
                             - If the person is near a hazardous location (such as stairs or a busy road), try to gently 
							 guide them to a safer area, if it can be done safely.
							<br> <br>
							<h5>3. Protect the Person's Head:</h5>
                             - Cushion their head with a soft object, such as a folded towel or clothing, to protect 
							 them from injury.
							 <br>
                             - Do not restrain the person or attempt to hold them down. Allow the seizure to run its course.
							 <br> <br>
							<h5>4. Do Not Insert Objects or Restrict Movements:</h5>
                            - Do not put anything in the person's mouth during a seizure. Contrary to popular belief, 
							it is not necessary and may cause injury.
							<br>
                             - Do not try to hold the person's movements or restrict their limbs. It is best to let the
							 seizure progress naturally.
							<br> <br>
							<h5>5. Time the Seizure:</h5>
                             - Note the time the seizure starts. If it lasts longer than five minutes or if multiple
							 seizures occur without recovery in between, it is considered a medical emergency. 
							 Call for emergency medical assistance.
							<h5>6. Observe and Reassure:</h5>
                            - Pay attention to the person's movements and the characteristics of the seizure. 
							This information can be helpful for medical professionals.
							<br>
                             -Stay with the person during the seizure and provide reassurance when they regain consciousness.
							<br> <br>
							<h5>7. Provide Post-Seizure Support:</h5>
                            - Once the seizure ends, the person may be confused, disoriented, or fatigued. 
							Speak calmly and offer support.
							<br>
                             -If necessary, help the person into a comfortable position and ensure they have 
							 access to fresh air.
							 <br>
                             - If the person is injured, provide appropriate first aid and, if needed, 
							 seek medical attention.
							<br> <br>
							<h5>8. Offer Emotional Support:</h5>
                            - Seizures can be distressing for the person experiencing them. Offer emotional 
							support and reassure them that you are there to help.
							<br> <br>
							<h5>9. Seek Medical Evaluation:</h5>
                             -Encourage the person to seek medical evaluation after a seizure, particularly 
							 if it is their first seizure, if the seizure was prolonged, or if there are concerns 
							 about their health.
							<br> <br>
							Note: If you encounter someone having a prolonged seizure (status epilepticus) lasting 
							longer than five minutes or if there are breathing difficulties or injuries, 
							call emergency medical services immediately.
							<br> <br>
							Remember, it is important to respect the privacy and dignity of the person having a 
							seizure and maintain their confidentiality.
							<br> <br>
