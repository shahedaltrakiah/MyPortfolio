                            <h2>Choking</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>Choking occurs when an object or a piece of food becomes lodged in the airway, obstructing 
						the flow of air. Prompt action is necessary to clear the airway and restore normal breathing. 
						The Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts) is the primary first aid technique used to treat 
						choking in adults and children above one year of age. For infants under one year, modified 
						techniques are used.
                             <br>
                        <p>Steps for First Aid for Choking(Adults and Children Above One Year):
                             <br>
                            <h5>1. Assess the Severity of Choking:</h5>
                             - Determine if the person is able to cough or speak. If they are coughing forcefully, 
							 encourage them to continue coughing to try and dislodge the object. If they are unable 
							 to cough, speak, or breathe effectively, immediate action is required.
							 <br> <br>
							<h5>2. Deliver the Heimlich Maneuver (Abdominal Thrusts):</h5>
                            - Stand behind the person and wrap your arms around their waist.
							<br>
                             - Make a fist with one hand and place the thumb side against the person's abdomen, 
							 slightly above the navel but below the ribcage.
                            <br>
                             - Grasp your fist with your other hand and give quick inward and upward thrusts into 
							 the abdomen, using your body weight to provide force.
                            <br>
                             - Repeat thrusts until the object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious. If 
							 the person becomes unconscious, lower them gently to the ground and begin CPR.
							<br> <br>
							<h5>3. Call for Emergency Medical Help:</h5>
                             - If the person is still choking after several attempts or loses consciousness, immediately 
							 call for emergency medical help and continue with the following steps.
							  <br> <br>
							<h5>4. Perform CPR (if necessary):</h5>
                            - If the person becomes unresponsive and is not breathing, lower them gently to the ground.
							<br>
                             - Begin CPR by performing chest compressions. Before each set of compressions, visually 
							 check the mouth for any visible obstructions and attempt to remove them.
							 <br>
                             - Open the airway using the head-tilt chin-lift technique, and give rescue breaths. 
							 If the breaths do not go in, reposition the head and try again. Do not force air in forcefully.
							 <br>
                             - Continue with cycles of chest compressions and rescue breaths until emergency help arrives or 
							 the person starts breathing normally.
							<br> <br>
							<h5>5. Manage Pain:</h5>
                             - Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used to help manage 
							 pain, following the recommended dosage instructions.
							 <br>
                             - Do not apply creams, ointments, or home remedies (like butter or toothpaste) to the burn, 
							 as they can interfere with healing and increase the risk of infection.
							<br> <br>
							<h5>6. Seek Medical Attention:</h5>
                            - For severe burns (deep second-degree burns or third-degree burns), or burns that cover a 
							large area of the body, call for emergency medical help immediately.
							<br>
							- Seek medical attention if the burn shows signs of infection (increased pain, redness, 
							swelling, or discharge), or if the person requires tetanus vaccination.
							<br> <br>
							Remember, first aid for burns is aimed at providing initial care and does not replace 
							professional medical evaluation and treatment. For severe burns or burns requiring medical 
							attention, it is crucial to seek immediate medical help.
							<br> <br>

						   guidance on first aid for burns and any other medical concerns, consult a healthcare professional
						   or refer to trusted medical resources.
